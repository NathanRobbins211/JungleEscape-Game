# JungleEscape-Game
A Unity demo game made over the course of one week for a class project to show all that I had been taught over the semester.
Gameplay consists of trying to escape a jungle by finding and collecting gems, fighting the enemies that protect those gems, and wandering around the map looking for said enemies, gems, and doors to progress.
